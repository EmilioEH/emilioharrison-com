I'd been clicking screener questions and likert rating scales for the past hour.\n\nThe message preview: Hey, you around for a quick call? Need your AI brain.\n\nHonestly? I was relieved. An excuse to do something actually interesting.\n\nMy coworker was stuck documenting a complex UI component sheet. Tedious, mind-numbing work. Could I \"vibe code something\" with AI to fix it?\n\nI hesitated before responding.\n\nNot because of the task. Because I knew my limits. I'm great at the quick wins, the standalone AI hacks. But deep system integration? Building something that integrates with Figma? I had doubts.\n\nI told him I'd look into it. I wasn't sure I actually could.\n\n## The Fear Under the Block\n\n![](../../assets/blogIMG/context-is-king/IMG_7161.png)\n\nWhat I didn't say on that call was that I didn't want to admit I might not be able to help.\n\nA few months earlier, I'd built an LLM-powered heuristic evaluation assistant and a thematic analysis assistant. Both got rolled out company-wide to all UX team members. They were getting attention. A month before this Figma request, I'd led my team to second place in a company-wide AI ideathon.\n\nI'd become the defacto AI guy. The person who teaches people about LLMs. The one who uses AI in creative ways to solve difficult problems.\n\nAnd now I was stuck on a Figma plugin, the exact kind of creative problem I was supposed to excel at.\n\nI'd been in this exact spot before. I sold vibe coding as something that would lead to \"UX Engineering.\" Because of that I was put on a project to vibe code a design system documentation site. Trying different prompts, tweaking the wording, hoping the right combination of words would unlock the solution. It never did.\n\nPretty soon I was in over my head and we had to bring in real developers. It was humbling.\n\nThe truth is that I was treating AI like a magic spell. Find the perfect incantation, get the perfect result.\n\nThat's exhausting and it isn't a scalable approach.\n\n## The Moment Everything Shifted\n\n![](../../assets/blogIMG/context-is-king/IMG_7163.png)\n\nLet me take you back to that full day…\n\nEarlier that morning, after standup, a coworker pulled me into an impromptu Zoom. They wanted to learn how to use LLMs better. I taught them the basics of prompting—you know, role assignment, temperature settings, that kind of thing. Then I walked them through context injection—the idea that you can feed an LLM specific information to guide its responses. We spent thirty minutes on it. I love this part of the work. This coworker was a self-described \"Luddite.\" Seeing them flip to actively seeking AI guidance? I was thrilled.\n\nI wrapped the call feeling good. Like I'd actually helped someone understand something useful.\n\nThen later that afternoon, my other coworker pinged me about the Figma plugin.\n\nI opened Claude. Tried different prompts. Refined the wording. Spent thirty minutes going in circles, the frustration building.\n\nThen something clicked.\n\nWait.\n\nThat conversation this morning. Context injection. What if the Figma problem wasn't a coding problem at all? What if it was just… a context problem?\n\nI was so convinced this would work that I raced to find the right context. But the whole time I couldn't stop thinking…\n\nIt can't be this easy.\n\nThe realization is that you don't need to memorize the recipe. You just need to know where the cookbook is.\n\n## What Context Engineering Actually Means\n\n![](../../assets/blogIMG/context-is-king/IMG_7157.png)\n\nI kept hearing \"prompt engineering\" everywhere. Optimize your prompts. Find the perfect phrasing. Make the AI do what you want.\n\nBut that's backwards.\n\nAnthropic puts it perfectly: \"Building with language models is becoming less about finding the right words and phrases for your prompts, and more about answering the broader question of 'what configuration of context is most likely to generate our model's desired behavior?'\"\n\nThink about giving someone directions. You can spend ten minutes trying to describe the route perfectly: \"Turn left at the third light, no wait, the fourth light, or is it after the gas station?\"\n\nOr you can just send them a map.\n\nThe map is the context. Stop perfecting your description. Send the map.\n\n## The Figma Documentation Experiment\n\n![](../../assets/blogIMG/context-is-king/IMG_7159.png)\n\nI pulled up the official Figma Academy developer documentation. All of it. I didn't read through it carefully. I didn't need to understand it myself. I just needed to give it to the AI.\n\nI copied the relevant sections: the API structure, the plugin examples, the method calls. Then I went back to Claude.\n\nThis time, I wasn't asking for a quick fix. I was setting up an environment where the AI could actually understand what I needed. I described the user experience we wanted: a tool that would automatically generate documentation for UI components.\n\nI hit send and watched it generate code.\n\nReal code. Code that actually referenced the correct Figma API methods. Code that I definitely couldn't have written myself.\n\nI sat there staring at my screen thinking: \"There's no way this actually works.\"\n\n### Testing the Impossible\n\nI copied the code into the Figma plugin editor. I was typing fast, trying to move quickly before I lost the momentum of the idea. I wanted to know if this would actually work or if I was just fooling myself.\n\nThis felt too easy. Years of required dev experience, bypassed by copying documentation?\n\nI hit run.\n\nThe plugin loaded. No errors.\n\nI opened a component in Figma, ran the plugin, and watched it pull the component properties and generate formatted documentation. Automatically. Exactly what my coworker needed.\n\nI messaged him: Got something. Want to see it?\n\nHis response: Wait, seriously? Already?\n\n### The Parking Lot Demo\n\nThe next morning, after standup, we went into our parking lot. The 15-minute open slot for quick demos and questions.\n\nI shared my screen and ran the plugin in Figma. The documentation generated in seconds.\n\n\"Okay, that's great,\" my coworker said. \"Can you make me one for layout specs too?\"\n\nThat's when I showed them the actual breakthrough.\n\nI pulled up the documentation I'd saved in Jira. A how-to file with the Figma docs and a template prompt. \"This is how I built it. Anyone can use this to build their own plugins.\"\n\nMy coworker opened Claude on his second monitor, copied the template, and started describing the layout tool he needed. We all watched the code generate in real-time.\n\nHe looked at the screen. \"Wait, it's really that simple?\"\n\nYou could see it click for everyone. They got it.\n\n## Building the Builder\n\nI didn't just solve one problem. I built a tool for them to solve their own problems. It's a bit meta, but this type of thinking is what turns a one off solution to a scalable approach for the whole team.\n\nOnce you inject the right context (the specific documentation, the precise API structure), the AI stops being a single-task assistant. It becomes a tool that builds other tools.\n\nMy coworker didn't need me anymore. He needed the documentation and basic knowledge of how to frame the request. That's it.\n\nWhich was the goal, obviously. But I couldn't stop thinking about that moment.\n\nI guess some part of me wondered: how many more times would I create AI solutions or teach myself out of work? Maybe that's dramatic. But it does feel like what all the headlines and AI hype are leading to.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not sure that's actually bad. Just… different than I expected.\n\nOne person's problem became a solution for the whole team. That's the difference between clever prompting and actual context engineering. But, I'm digressing, this is probably a topic I'll explore in a different post.\n\n## Why Context Always Wins\n\n![](../../assets/blogIMG/context-is-king/IMG_7160.png)\n\nYou can spend hours perfecting your prompt. You can try different phrasings, different structures, different approaches.\n\nBut if the model doesn't have the right information, you're just hoping it guesses correctly.\n\nThe model has limited attention. Like your working memory when you're trying to remember a phone number while someone's talking to you. Why waste that attention making the AI figure out API structure when you can just provide it?\n\nThe skill isn't writing better prompts. It's knowing what information the AI is missing and where to find it.\n\nThis matters because it changes what skills you need to work effectively with AI.\n\nYou don't have to become an expert in prompt engineering, which is basically a whole field of study at this point, complete with frameworks and best practices and probably certification programs soon.\n\nYou have to learn how to find answers to your problems. And make good decisions about what's really needed to solve them.\n\nIt's sort of like human-driven RAG. Human in the loop. You're not trying to make the AI smarter through better prompting. You're making yourself a better curator of the information the AI needs.\n\nThat's a completely different skill. And honestly, it feels more sustainable than trying to keep up with the latest prompt engineering techniques.\n\n## The Honest Limitation\n\nThis approach isn't magic. It only works when you have good source material.\n\nIf your context is vague, contradictory, or requires subjective creative judgment, this falls apart. I can't inject context to make AI write a novel only I could write or design something that needs my specific aesthetic judgment.\n\nBut for technical integration? For working with established systems that have documentation? For building tools that follow existing patterns? Context engineering changes everything.\n\n## What You Can Do\n\nYou don't need to become a technical expert. You need to become a curator of good information.\n\nNext time you're stuck on a hard problem, try this: Open two tabs. In one, find the official docs for whatever system you're working with—developer guide, how to article, or the book about this topic. In the other, open your LLM.\n\nCopy the sections that seem relevant. Yes, all of them. Then describe what you need in plain language. Don't optimize your prompt. Just explain the problem like you're talking to a coworker who knows the system.\n\nSee what happens.\n\nYou might be surprised how much you can build without being the expert. You just need to know where the experts already wrote down what they know.\n\nYou might be the one giving demos in parking lots next week.","src/content/posts/context-is-king.mdoc",[40],"../../assets/blogIMG/context-is-king/cover.png","1535b7844c72a940","context-is-king.mdoc",true,"hello-world",{"id":44,"data":46,"body":58,"filePath":59,"digest":60,"legacyId":61,"deferredRender":43},{"title":47,"status":15,"date":48,"category":49,"excerpt":50,"takeaways":51},"Hello World","Nov 26, 2025","general","This is a sample post written in Markdown.",[52,55],{"title":53,"text":54},"Markdown is Easy","You can write complex posts using simple text syntax.",{"title":56,"text":57},"Dual Modes","Readers can switch between deep reading and quick skimming.","# Welcome to the Blog\n\nThis is a sample post to demonstrate the **Markdown** capabilities.\n\n## Features\n- Write in standard Markdown\n- Add images: ![Placeholder](/vite.svg)\n- Code blocks:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\");\n```\n\nEnjoy writing!","src/content/posts/hello-world.mdoc","3a16476e79a09336","hello-world.mdoc","youre-the-one-who-clicks-submit",{"id":62,"data":64,"body":92,"filePath":93,"digest":94,"legacyId":95,"deferredRender":43},{"title":65,"status":15,"date":48,"category":17,"tags":66,"excerpt":72,"takeaways":73},"You're the One Who Clicks Submit",[21,67,68,69,70,71],"ai-testing","accountability","ux-research","hallucinations","human-in-the-loop","When you use an LLM, you're the driver.

The heuristic evaluation looked clean. Professional formatting, proper severity ratings, all ten heuristics addressed. The kind of thing that would make stakeholders nod approvingly in a presentation.\n\nBut I couldn't shake this question: What if someone actually uses this?\n\nSix months earlier, my coworker built something that made me simultaneously impressed and jealous. He created a prompt injection platform with a clever workaround. No RAG capabilities? Just embed the entire knowledge base in the system prompt. The first LLM assistant he created was a dark and deceptive pattern evaluator. Upload UI screenshots, get back analysis of dark and deceptive patterns. The results were undeniably compelling.\n\nThat's when the lightbulb went off: We could do the same thing for heuristic evaluation.\n\nI told him about the idea. He built a prototype. Immediately, I felt that competitive itch: This was my idea and I'm the UX researcher. I have to show this guy I can build something better. (Petty, I know)\n\n## The Problem With \"Good Enough\"\n\nI started with his first draft and began adapting it. Added UXR knowledge from years of running heuristic evaluations myself. Refined the prompt. Tested it on a UI screen I knew had problems. Adjusted the wording. Tested again.\n\nAfter a half-dozen rounds of tweaking, the fifth iteration caught every issue I'd already identified. I looked at the output and thought, This is good enough to ship.\n\nThat's when the real question hit me: But how do I actually know it works?\n\nI'd proven it worked once. On one screen. That I already understood.\n\nBut I was about to hand this to other researchers and designers. Who would use it on designs I'd never seen. And trust the output enough to make decisions based on it.\n\nWhat happens when someone runs this on a different UI? What if they present the findings to stakeholders? What if those stakeholders make product decisions based on what the LLM said?\n\nI realized I had no answer. I'd built something that looked professional, sounded authoritative, and might be completely unreliable.\n\nJust click copy. It's fine. It looks good.\n\nBut that voice saying \"it's fine\" was me being lazy. I had almost convinced myself that I could realize this in the wild. Until I saw what happens when someone skips it.\n\nThe Deloitte headline: $400,000 refund because an AI tool hallucinated. Someone at Deloitte probably had a good day when they submitted that report. Fast turnaround, impressive output. Then came the discovery that it was wrong. With their name on it. With their credibility attached to it.\n\nThat's the nightmare scenario. Not a pulled tool. A $400K mistake.\n\nI was starting to see a common thread from my own work and now the Deloitte headline: someone decided an LLM output was good enough without verifying it actually was.\n\n## Figuring Out Good Enough to Tested\n\nI didn't sit down and design a testing methodology. I just tried answering open questions.\n\nFirst question: Does it give me the same answer with the same inputs?\n\nI ran the same design through the same prompt five times. Not because five is statistically rigorous. It's not. But because it felt like enough to see if a pattern held.\n\nI sat there watching each output generate.\n\nFirst run: identifies contrast issues, navigation problems, three severity-high items.\nSecond run: same issues, different wording.\nThird run: same issues, different wording. Wait… 1 new issue…. Hmm interesting.\nFourth run: back to the same issues, different wording.\nFifth run: same issues, different wording.\n\nFive out of five consistent with some variance. Is that good enough to claim tested? I didn't know. But at least now I knew consistency was a thing I needed to measure. And I had a table stakes approach.\n\nThe outputs varied in wording, obviously. LLMs are probabilistic. But I wasn't looking for identical text. I was checking whether it consistently identified the same usability issues at the same severity levels.\n\nThen the second question emerged: What if I just made a prompt that was hard-coded to find usability issues in the one screen? (I think in the industry they call this over-fitting)\n\nI needed to know if the prompt would scale. So I grabbed five different UI designs I was already familiar with, ones where I knew the usability problems. Ran each through the prompt. Waited for the outputs.\n\nScreen one: caught the issues I expected.\nScreen two: caught those too, plus flagged something I'd missed.\nScreen three: clean identification.\nScreen four: clean.\nScreen five: clean, with one extra insight that actually made sense.\n\nAgain, the \"5\" was arbitrary. It seemed like a good round number. Enough to feel confident without spending a week on testing.\n\nThat moment, watching it work on designs it had never seen, that's when I felt like I could actually hand this to someone else. Not because I'd proven it was perfect. Because I'd verified it was consistent and it generalized beyond the sample I'd tuned it on.\n\nI set the threshold at 5x5: five runs for consistency, five different scenarios for accuracy. Is that sufficient? I still don't know. But it's the line between \"I hope this works\" and \"I've tested it.\"\n\nThat testing protocol felt sufficient for what I was building.\n\n## The Line I'm Still Drawing\n\nSo where's the line? When is testing paranoia versus professionalism?\n\nI use the test when the prompt will be reused and used by others. Scalability is the trigger. If I'm building something that five people, or fifty people, will rely on, I use the 5x5 threshold: five runs for consistency, five different scenarios for accuracy.\n\nBut I don't test everything. One-off prompts? Quick analyses for my own decision-making? I get something good enough and move on. The key difference is who's relying on it and what's at stake if it's wrong.\n\nI also intentionally pick use cases that are low-risk and revertable. Human in the loop, always. I'm not building fully automated systems because I don't trust that I could test them thoroughly enough.\n\nThat's the safety net. Low stakes, easy to fix if something goes sideways, always a person checking the work. Capitalizing on \"human-in-the-loop\" is key.\n\nI'm still not sure if that's enough.\n\n## The Questions I Can't Answer Yet\n\nIs the 5x5 threshold actually sufficient for high-stakes scenarios? It feels right based on my experience, but \"feels right\" isn't exactly rigorous methodology. What if I need 10x10? What if the stakes are high enough that even thorough testing isn't enough? What if I need a large scale fully automated python script testing?\n\nAnd then there's the practical problem: How do I convince other people to test when they just want to ship fast?\n\nI've watched colleagues grab an LLM output, glance at it, and immediately use it in a presentation or send it to a client. When I suggest testing it first, I get the look: Why are you wasting time? It looks good.\n\nIt's hard to argue for caution when nothing's gone wrong yet. The Deloitte story helps, but it feels distant. That was a massive consulting firm, not us. Until something breaks in a visible, costly way, testing feels like paranoia instead of professionalism.\n\nAnd I've gotten questions from peers about losing any efficiency gains because I spend time testing.\n\nThe bigger challenge is scaling this practice across a team that's moving fast. Even if I convince people to test, who has time? We're all under pressure to deliver quickly. Testing adds friction. And in a world where \"AI makes everything faster,\" stopping to verify outputs feels like you're resisting progress.\n\nMy point is this: when you use an LLM to do work, you're still the one accountable for the output.\n\n## You're the Driver\n\nThe AI didn't submit the Deloitte report. A person did. When something generated by an LLM goes wrong, you don't get to say, \"Oops, the AI messed up.\" You're the driver, not the passenger.\n\nBefore you ship an LLM output that other people will trust, you have to be willing to defend it. Not just \"it looks good,\" but \"I've verified it's accurate and consistent.\"\n\nThe person at Deloitte who submitted that hallucinated report probably wishes they'd spent an extra hour testing it.\n\nI'd rather be the person who tests too much than the person who tests too little and learns the hard way.\n\nIf you're building LLM-powered tools, what's your testing threshold? How do you know when \"good enough\" is actually good enough? I'm still figuring this out. If you've found answers I haven't, I want to hear them.","src/content/posts/youre-the-one-who-clicks-submit.mdoc","89c828626a007be0","youre-the-one-who-clicks-submit.mdoc","the-ai-expert-who-doesnt-know-what-a-token-is",{"id":96,"data":98,"body":129,"filePath":130,"digest":131,"legacyId":132,"deferredRender":43},{"title":99,"status":15,"date":48,"category":100,"tags":101,"excerpt":106,"takeaways":107},"The AI Expert in the Room (Who Doesn't Know What a Token Is)","professional-growth",[21,102,103,22,104,105],"tokens","imposter-syndrome","honesty","expertise","We're all faking expertise in AI.

Two minutes later, he's talking about \"training ChatGPT on our company data\" and how \"the AI learns from every conversation.\"\n\nI ask, \"Quick clarification, when you say training, do you mean fine-tuning or just adding context to prompts?\"\n\nSilence. Then, \"Yeah, exactly, training.\"\n\nHe doesn't know. And suddenly, I realize he has no idea what a token is, what a context window does, or the difference between inference and training. But he needed to sound like an expert. And I get it. I really do.\n\n## We're All Faking It\n\nThere's this thing happening right now in every Slack channel, every standup, every coffee chat about AI. People are posturing as experts while getting foundational concepts completely wrong.\n\nThe thing is, I don't think it's arrogance. I think it's terror.\n\nAI feels like an extinction-level event for knowledge work. Every article screams that our jobs are at risk. Every LinkedIn post shows someone claiming they \"10x'd their productivity with AI.\" The implicit message: If you're not an AI expert, you're obsolete.\n\nSo we perform expertise. We throw around \"large language models\" and \"prompt engineering\" and \"AI agents\" like shields against irrelevance.\n\n## I did it too\n\nFor the past 5 years, I've been an expert in UX Research. I knew the methodologies. I could moderate a usability test in my sleep. I had mastery, and that felt good. Safe.\n\nThen AI exploded, and suddenly I'm in conversations where people are talking about embeddings and vector databases and RAG architectures. My expertise felt… quaint. Like showing up to a rocket launch with a really nice bicycle.\n\nSo I did exactly what that guy in the Zoom call did. I started nodding along. Dropping terms I'd read in articles. Positioning myself as someone who \"gets it.\"\n\nIn one meeting, I confidently explained how we could \"leverage AI to automate our research synthesis\" without actually understanding what that would require.\n\nA designer asked a follow-up question about how the model would handle qualitative data, and I… deflected. Changed the subject. Performed confidence I didn't have.\n\nI was so afraid of looking like I was falling behind that I'd rather bullshit than admit I didn't know.\n\n## The Quote That Changed My POV\n\nThen I read this line from Brené Brown:\n\n\"The big shift here is from wanting to 'be right' to wanting to 'get it right.'\"\n\nIt hit me like a door to the face. I was so focused on appearing valuable, on being right about AI, that I'd stopped trying to actually learn. To get it right.\n\nThe posturing wasn't helping me. It was keeping me shallow. I was rehearsing answers instead of asking questions. I was protecting my ego instead of learning.\n\n## Why This Is So Hard\n\nHere's the thing I want to acknowledge: The fear is real.\n\nAI is changing knowledge work. Jobs are being redefined. The ground is shifting under all of us.\n\nWhen you've spent years building expertise in one domain, and suddenly there's a new domain that feels existential, of course you grasp for credibility. Of course you perform confidence you don't have.\n\nIt's not stupidity. It's survival instinct.\n\nAnd learning publicly, admitting you don't know something in front of colleagues, in front of your boss, in front of people who might be deciding your future, is genuinely vulnerable. It feels like handing someone ammunition.\n\nSometimes, in some rooms, a little strategic positioning is necessary. I get it.\n\nBut here's what I've learned: The performance has a cost. It keeps you from actually learning the thing you're pretending to know. It keeps you in shallow conversations instead of deep ones. And it makes you spend energy managing an image instead of building real capability.\n\n## What I'm Trying Now\n\nI started saying \"I don't know\" out loud.\n\nIn meetings. In Slack. In conversations with people I want to impress.\n\n\"I don't actually understand how fine-tuning works, can you explain that?\"\n\n\"I've read about RAG but I haven't implemented it. What's your experience been?\"\n\n\"I'm still figuring this out. Can we think through it together?\"\n\nAnd here's what happened: Nothing bad. No one thought I was incompetent. Most people seemed relieved to have permission to also not know everything.\n\nThe designer who asked me that follow-up question? We ended up having an hour-long conversation where we both admitted we were confused about the same things. We learned together. We actually got it right instead of pretending we already were.\n\n## An Invitation\n\nNext time you're in a conversation about AI or any new, scary thing try noticing the gap between what you're saying and what you actually understand.\n\nNotice if you're reaching for jargon to sound credible. Notice if you're nodding along when you're actually lost. Notice if someone else is doing the performance, and maybe offer them an out: \"I'm still learning this stuff too, want to figure it out together?\"\n\nThe shift from \"be right\" to \"get it right\" isn't easy. It won't feel safe at first.\n\nBut I'm finding it's the only way to actually learn. And maybe, the only way to build real expertise in something that's changing this fast.\n\nYou don't have to be the expert. You just have to be honest about where you are.","src/content/posts/the-ai-expert-who-doesnt-know-what-a-token-is.mdoc","1bb3560e40b73311","the-ai-expert-who-doesnt-know-what-a-token-is.mdoc","when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time",{"id":133,"data":135,"body":161,"filePath":162,"assetImports":163,"digest":165,"legacyId":166,"deferredRender":43},{"title":136,"status":137,"publishedDate":138,"date":48,"category":17,"tags":139,"excerpt":145,"takeaways":146,"cover":159,"coverAlt":160},"When Your AI Breakthrough Doesn't Save Anyone Time","scheduled",["Date","2025-11-30T11:00:00.000Z"],[68,140,141,142,22,143,144],"ai-implementation","professional-development","jobs-to-be-done","reflection","mental-model","Ask what job needs doing before building with AI, or risk creating technically impressive solutions nobody actually needs.",[147,150,153,156],{"title":148,"text":149},"Ask what job needs doing","Before building with AI, identify what painful job people are actually trying to solve.

Mid-afternoon on a Tuesday. Just shut it down and walked away from my desk.\n\nA few hours earlier, I demoed a Figma plugin I built for the team. Something to help with design system documentation work. The demo went well. People seemed excited. There was celebration. I felt good.\n\nThen I pinged my coworker to se how it was working and to see if it was saving any time compared to the old way. Nothing official, just a quick check in.\n\nHe responded, “oh ya it’s working. Not really saving much time because this is already a quick process. It’s actually pretty easy.”\n\nI messaged another teammate. Same thing. Then he sent me a list of other plugins that would ACTUALLY be time savers.\n\nThat’s when I closed Teams.\n\n---\n\n![Illustration showing a blue figure looking through a telescope at code in the clouds while a coral-colored user waves their hands trying to get attention - visualizing how builders can focus on technical implementation while missing what users actually need.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​](../../assets/blogIMG/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time/Observing%20Users%20Before%20Building%20Solutions.jpeg)\n\nA month later I realized the problem with the plugin was that I never asked “what job was my plugin being hired to do?”\n\nI focused purely on the technical questions like “what does it do” or “how does it work”, but never the Jobs to be Done question: what painful job were people hiring my plugin to solve?\n\nThe answer in this case?\n\nNothing. There was no painful job.\n\nThe documentation work was already quick. Already easy. They’d already hired something, their current process, and it worked fine.\n\nI’d built a solution to a problem that didn’t exist.\n\n---\n\n![Illustration contrasting two approaches: on the left, a purple figure calmly holding an organized framework document against a grid background; on the right, a coral figure struggling with a chaotic, teetering stack of blocks amid scribbles and chaos - visualizing the difference between methodical discovery and improvised building.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​](../../assets/blogIMG/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time/Structured%20Process%20vs.%20Ad%20Hoc%20Experimentation.jpeg)\n\nOver that month, I was working on a different project that *was* using Jobs to be Done. More formal process: watching users, documenting observations, creating JTBD maps based on what we saw.\n\nThe contrast between the two approaches became impossible to ignore.\n\nThe JTBD work forced us to ask *what should we build?* before anything else. What job are people trying to get done? What are they currently hiring to do that job? Why is their solution insufficient?\n\nThe Figma plugin? I’d only asked *how do I build what I was asked for?*\n\nMy coworker said “can you build something to help with documentation” and I immediately started thinking: *how do I solve this technical problem? What’s the right approach? Can I actually pull this off?*\n\nI never asked if documentation was actually painful for them. What’s the current process? Why does it need fixing?\n\nThe difference between a real project and an ad hoc request. JTBD led to understanding what we should build. The plugin was just about figuring out how to build the thing I was told to build.\n\nYou can read more about the technical side—how I eventually figured out the “how”—in [Context is King](https://uxpromptlab.com/blogs/lab-notes/context-is-king). But that’s not really the point.\n\nThe point is I built something nobody needed because I never asked if they needed it.\n\n## What was I actually excited about?\n\n![Illustration showing a figure balancing precariously on a chaotic house of cards while holding up an AI globe - visualizing how building AI solutions without understanding user needs creates an unstable foundation destined to collapse.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​](../../assets/blogIMG/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time/Building%20on%20a%20House%20of%20Cards.jpeg)\n\n*Why did I jump straight to building?*\n\nHonestly, I was excited about seeing if I could build something technical with AI.\n\nNot solving a problem anyone had. Solving the challenge of making it work.\n\nWhen my coworker asked about the plugin, I heard “Figma plugin for documentation” and my brain immediately went: *This is possible with AI. How do I make it work? I need to learn more.*\n\nThat curiosity is genuine. It’s not about impressing people or proving myself to others. It’s about being genuinely fascinated by what’s suddenly possible.\n\n*Wow, this is possible? How do I solve this technical problem?*\n\nI got so absorbed in that technical puzzle that I never stepped back to ask whether the thing should exist.\n\n“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.” - Dr. Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park\n\nNot quite as dramatic as creating terrorizing dinosaurs, but the principle still stands.\n\n## When is that excitement the right response?\n\n![Illustration showing a figure running inside a hamster wheel-like geometric sphere labeled “technical puzzle” - visualizing how getting absorbed in solving technical problems can become a self-contained loop that loses sight of whether the solution is actually needed.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​](../../assets/blogIMG/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time/Trapped%20in%20the%20Technical%20Puzzle.jpeg)\n\nSometimes that absorption in the technical puzzle IS the right move.\n\nLearning. Experimenting. Exploring what’s possible beyond the hype. That matters. That’s how you figure out what AI can actually do.\n\nBut sometimes it means I build something nobody needs.\n\nSince I’ve had some time since this realization, I think I’ve come up with some criteria to consider when I’m in this situation:\n\n![Illustration showing a purple figure balancing on a seesaw while juggling three shapes labeled “stakes,” “scope,” and “role” - visualizing the framework for deciding when to experiment freely versus when to slow down and do proper discovery.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​](../../assets/blogIMG/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time/Balancing%20Stakes,%20Scope,%20and%20Role.jpeg)\n\n- **Stakes:** Low stakes, experiment freely. High stakes, slow down and ask questions first.\n- **Scope:** Quick one-off for yourself, just build it. Tool for the whole team, do discovery.\n- **Role:** Personal learning, follow the curiosity. Professional delivery, follow the process.\n\nThose all make sense when I write them out like this, but in the moment when I’m staring at an interesting technical problem?\n\nI’ll probably still just start building.\n\n## Where’s the line?\n\n![Illustration showing a teal figure balancing on a seesaw between a yellow cube labeled “tech” on one side and a coral figure labeled “human” on the other - visualizing the challenge of balancing technical experimentation with understanding actual user needs.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​](../../assets/blogIMG/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time/Finding%20the%20Balance%20Between%20Technical%20Curiosity%20and%20User%20Needs.jpeg)\n\nI haven’t actually applied Jobs to be Done to an AI project yet.\n\nPartly because I haven’t had the right project. But mostly because the ad-hoc nature of AI experimentation is too exciting. I get wrapped up in figuring out what’s possible. The technical puzzle pulls me in before I remember to slow down.\n\nI’m trying to find the balance between that excitement and working diligently the right way.\n\nI know the formal JTBD process works. It led to understanding what we should build, but it’s hard in the moment to force that intentionality into the puzzle work of AI.\n\nNext time I get excited about building something with AI, I’m going to TRY asking “what job is this being hired for?” first. I’m going to try talking to the people who would use it. I’m going to try asking what’s actually painful about their current process.\n\nBut I’ll probably still get absorbed in the technical puzzle immediately. I’ll probably still jump to “how do I make this work?” before I’ve fully explored whether anyone needs it to work.\n\nOR\n\nOn the whole side, I might over-correct. I might spend too much time on discovery and kill the experimental momentum. I might lose what makes this work exciting.\n\nI’d rather fail by being too careful than build another plugin that gets a polite “oh ya it’s working” before everyone goes back to their old way of doing things.\n\nBut I don’t know if that’s actually true. I don’t know if I’ll slow down when I should. I don’t know where the line is between necessary experimentation and building things nobody needs.\n\n---\n\n*If you’ve figured out how to balance AI experimentation with understanding actual user needs, I want to hear about it. Because I’m actively trying to find that balance, and I don’t have good answers yet.*","src/content/posts/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time.mdoc",[164],"../../assets/blogIMG/when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time/cover.jpeg","12af696203945818","when-your-ai-breakthrough-doesnt-save-anyone-time.mdoc","categories",["Map",169,170,49,175,100,180,17,185],"ai-automation",{"id":169,"data":171,"filePath":173,"digest":174},{"name":172},"AI & Automation","src/content/categories/ai-automation.json","1d1c33ec78ff7d85",{"id":49,"data":176,"filePath":178,"digest":179},{"name":177},"General","src/content/categories/general.json","a22b3c38fa27f3ba",{"id":100,"data":181,"filePath":183,"digest":184},{"name":182},"Professional Growth","src/content/categories/professional-growth.json","50e4c173a79eb62f",{"id":17,"data":186,"filePath":188,"digest":189},{"name":187},"Lessons Learned","src/content/categories/lessons-learned.json","a4068a5b8904f17c","tags",["Map",68,192,105,196,200,201,67,205,209,210,19,214,23,218,20,222,70,226,230,231,104,235,71,239,22,243,103,247,251,252,256,257,21,261,265,266,102,270,69,274,140,278,142,283,144,288,141,293,143,298],{"id":68,"data":193,"filePath":194,"digest":195},{"name":68},"src/content/tags/accountability.json","564a306dac799ef4",{"id":105,"data":197,"filePath":198,"digest":199},{"name":105},"src/content/tags/expertise.json","90f40a32851518ae","ai-validation",{"id":200,"data":202,"filePath":203,"digest":204},{"name":200},"src/content/tags/ai-validation.json","257a1aae185ce192",{"id":67,"data":206,"filePath":207,"digest":208},{"name":67},"src/content/tags/ai-testing.json","47cd04d01ffac58e","5x5-testing",{"id":209,"data":211,"filePath":212,"digest":213},{"name":209},"src/content/tags/5x5-testing.json","9e0253e491197ef4",{"id":19,"data":215,"filePath":216,"digest":217},{"name":19},"src/content/tags/context-engineering.json","d9116519e445daaa",{"id":23,"data":219,"filePath":220,"digest":221},{"name":23},"src/content/tags/figma-plugins.json","e2a847b596a10903",{"id":20,"data":223,"filePath":224,"digest":225},{"name":20},"src/content/tags/documentation.json","6d9f78ccffef3462",{"id":70,"data":227,"filePath":228,"digest":229},{"name":70},"src/content/tags/hallucinations.json","23a98e19c84232ad","heuristic-evaluation",{"id":230,"data":232,"filePath":233,"digest":234},{"name":230},"src/content/tags/heuristic-evaluation.json","d1eab848ee4f3797",{"id":104,"data":236,"filePath":237,"digest":238},{"name":104},"src/content/tags/honesty.json","8191e8638dea5518",{"id":71,"data":240,"filePath":241,"digest":242},{"name":71},"src/content/tags/human-in-the-loop.json","1b4cc8439adac836",{"id":22,"data":244,"filePath":245,"digest":246},{"name":22},"src/content/tags/learning-in-public.json","22f7cc69aca2511c",{"id":103,"data":248,"filePath":249,"digest":250},{"name":103},"src/content/tags/imposter-syndrome.json","564b21052a0fb899","reusable-solutions",{"id":251,"data":253,"filePath":254,"digest":255},{"name":251},"src/content/tags/reusable-solutions.json","42a9cb0020f40354","teaching",{"id":256,"data":258,"filePath":259,"digest":260},{"name":256},"src/content/tags/teaching.json","2d7e4c079393ac7f",{"id":21,"data":262,"filePath":263,"digest":264},{"name":21},"src/content/tags/llm.json","5d26eabb5c6f0a3f","testing-methodology",{"id":265,"data":267,"filePath":268,"digest":269},{"name":265},"src/content/tags/testing-methodology.json","a38ecbfd02b36fae",{"id":102,"data":271,"filePath":272,"digest":273},{"name":102},"src/content/tags/tokens.json","942d840ab86d0f50",{"id":69,"data":275,"filePath":276,"digest":277},{"name":69},"src/content/tags/ux-research.json","7836ebd2efa21708",{"id":140,"data":279,"filePath":281,"digest":282},{"name":280},"AI Implementation","src/content/tags/ai-implementation.json","2ea28ac3428b41d3",{"id":142,"data":284,"filePath":286,"digest":287},{"name":285},"Jobs To Be Done","src/content/tags/jobs-to-be-done.json","9e6974847afc9c5d",{"id":144,"data":289,"filePath":291,"digest":292},{"name":290},"Mental Model","src/content/tags/mental-model.json","af5dd3db4bddd7c3",{"id":141,"data":294,"filePath":296,"digest":297},{"name":295},"Professional Development","src/content/tags/professional-development.json","0a42284f58eed76b",{"id":143,"data":299,"filePath":301,"digest":302},{"name":300},"Reflection","src/content/tags/reflection.json","521cb44be5a41efd"]
